Welcome to the TransitSHIME GitHub Page!

Here, you will find the codebase that was used to conduct the analyses presented in our published paper titled "<b>Gut microbiota response to <i>in vitro</i> transit time variation is mediated by microbial growth rates, nutrient use efficiency and adaptation to <i>in vivo</i> transit time</b>", a.k.a <b>TransitSHIME</b> This repository contains the code and configurations that were employed to generate the results and insights discussed in the paper.

## About the Paper

In the paper "<b>Gut microbiota response to <i>in vitro</i> transit time variation is mediated by microbial growth rates, nutrient use efficiency and adaptation to <i>in vivo</i> transit time</b>", we attempted to investigate the effects of transit time on an <i>in vitro</i> gut microbial community. To gain a deeper understanding of the context and significance of the analyses performed here, we strongly encourage you to refer to the paper. You can access the paper [Link](URL) to get a comprehensive overview.

### Reference

If you would use or build upon this code, please refer to Minnebo <i> et al.</i>, (2023) Gut microbiota response to <i>in vitro</i> transit time variation is mediated by microbial growth rates, nutrient use efficiency and adaptation to <i>in vivo</i> transit time</b>. <i>Microbiome</i> vol. X, p X-X

## What are the Repository contents?

This GitHub repository is organised to provide easy access to the code used in the analyses:

- **Code**: This section holds the source code responsible for conducting the analyses detailed in the paper. Each script is thoroughly documented to help you follow the process step by step.
- **Supporting code**: The main code is supported by own external scripts, such as ggplot altering codes, a bundle of colours, calculations of effect sizes...
- **Datasets**: In cases where datasets were employed for these analyses, we have included them here. These datasets are crucial for reproducing the results and drawing further insights.

## How to Use

If you're interested in replicating the analyses or building upon them, you can start by navigating to the `Code` directory. Inside, you will find individual scripts and markdowns that correspond to different aspects of the analyses carried out in the paper. Each script contains comments and explanations to guide you through the implementation.

### Which markdowns contain the code to which figures/results?

As you can see, there are 3 markdowns in the code: Analysis-Illumina.Rmd, FCM_analyses.Rmd and SCFA_analyses.Rmd. Each of them contain codes to specific results and figures:
* <b>Analysis-Illumina.Rmd</b>: Figure 



Feel free to experiment, modify, and expand upon the code as you see fit. Should you encounter any questions or obstacles, we encourage you to raise an Issue in this repository. 



Happy (re)analysing!
